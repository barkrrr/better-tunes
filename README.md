# BetterTunes

## Description

This is a SPA where users can find and listen to music based on different search terms.

## Testing 
-  As a first step the iTunes API was tested in Postman, and raw data from the API response was analyzed to better understand the content of the API.
- [Response Example](./response-example.json)
- [Postman Collection](./better-tunes.postman_collection.json)

## User Stories

-  **404:** As a user of the app I want to see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault.
- **Homepage:** As a user I want to be able to search for my favorite album or artist, and sort my search terms.
-  **Player page** As a user I want to listen to different songs on an album, pause and skip a song, and retrieve more information about the album and artist.
